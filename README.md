Basic tools for working with tracks.

* `track_output.py`: Output a track (provided an id) to present JSON or CSV
* `diff_lessons.rb`: Compare two track's lessons and print a summary
* A forked version of `github/hub` at `sgharms/hub` can be used for [issue reporting](./issue_reporting_with_hub_fork.md)
